# stock-analysis
Module 2 VBA
## Overview of Project
Steve loves the workbook I prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.


## Results
The results of the stock analysis, since 2017 to 2018, shows that the portfolio did not give good return due to the negative percentages which in fact means loses for the volume invested.
